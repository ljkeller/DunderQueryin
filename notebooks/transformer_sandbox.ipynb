      "Encoding. Sample: Okay.\n",

      "Encoding. Sample: Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: No, no, no, NO, no!  You know what?  Fat people are not monsters!  Why don't you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject.  Bang!  Boom!  Case in point!  Look at the outside of this building.  It is ugly.  But you come inside... and it is beautiful.  Just like this unappealing fat suit.  Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: Oh cause of last night?  No way.  Reports have been exaggerated.  Weddings make me very emotional.  I um--I just have that side to me.\n",

      "Encoding. Sample: Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: That's no burst pipe.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: It's ok. We're having fun. It's not actually the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing. [Jim signals for making to stop] No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse. [Michael begins to lose his cool] Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'Who are your 5 friends?' and I'm, like, 'Uh... ' I didn't even know I couldn't even think. [realizing he's going downhill] Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'.  Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: The problem with having 'It' or 'the X-factor' or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table.  So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor.  It's not even that much of a stretch.  She pretty much does whatever I say.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: What?\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: Mm-hmm.  Yes, I'm fine.  Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.\n",

      "Encoding. Sample: Hello. I would like a hot dog please. Now, I don't have any money so here is what I would like to do. I leave you here with my watch, and I come back later to pay for the hot dog.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: Um, everyone was getting their driver's license.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]\n",

      "Encoding. Sample: It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates 'Monster Mash.' I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: How do you even know they're gay?\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: Dwight, please.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: Well... no, I'm not. So I... I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. Another day.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: Here we go, let's sit down.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.\n",

      "Encoding. Sample: What did I do?\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: Ten...\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: Uh huh.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: It sounds mean.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: Why'd you come back?  Why didn't you stay?\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: Exactly, ask me, which you did, so, tell a joke.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: Sound good. Sounds fun.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.\n",

      "Encoding. Sample: Not at all.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: [whispers] Yeah.\n",

      "Encoding. Sample: Come on. You got this. Here.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: Hey, I'm so glad you came down. It's been so much harder than I expected.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: You know what this is like?  I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: That's really not cool.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. [starts to cry] And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.\n",
      "Encoding. Sample: I got it on a website, that's not important.\n",

I've made some decisions that I'm not proud of; my marriage, being overly litigious with my family.  I orgasm fairly easily. Michael was kind of like my dirty secret, you know, having sex with him, oh I was just turned on by my own degradation.  Um, why, anyway, I was told by somebody recently that I respect that I'm old enough to have a mature relationship, and that's what this whole evening is about and I have high hopes.\n",
